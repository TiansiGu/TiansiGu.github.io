I am Tiansi Gu, a Computer Science Master student at the University of San Francisco. I have completed two internships at Amazon Web Services, where I worked on scalable, LLM-driven software system and infrastructure for clinical note generations. I am passionate about building robust GenAI applications and exploring Machine Learning projects with model training and performance optimization. I am also highly-skilled in SRE/DevOps, with experience of CI/CD pipelines, containerization, and clusters management. Outside of work, I enjoy hiking, swimming, and reading about the next generation of AI talent.
