We trained traditional ML models and Neural Netwroks (including Word Embeddings, LSTM, and BERT) to identify sentiment polarity on cosmetic product reviews.

- This project also used feature engineering techniques (e.g. SMOTE, Lemmatization, TF-IDF, ) and hyper-parameter finetuning.
- Improved classification f1 score by 10% on average, and up to 89.8% via tuned LSTM model.
